# TheSocialNetwork

## Description

The following app is a "social network", where people can create their user with their name and an email address, when creating an user, they are allowed to add other users as friends and share their thoughts and react to their friends' thoughts. It also allows them to edit any thought they post or any reaction. In addition, an user is allowed to delete their own user, any friend, thought or reaction. This app was developed with the use of MongoDB to store the data, as well as Express.js for routing the API. The app uses the GET POST, PUT, DELETE to interact with the app.
